<h3> Content</h3>
<p>
 To be successful IT graduates need to understand the use of industry tools and practices, the ways these tools work <br>
 and connect together, and the underlying professional, ethical, and teamwork knowledge and skills needed to put these <br>
 into practice in a professional manner. This unit introduces students to IT workflows, agile project management, 
 dev-ops<br> pipelines, version control, and the ways these tools fit together in modern companies. The use of these 
 technologies<br> is underpinned by the behaviours, teamwork, and ethical considerations needed to engage in working in IT  
 in a profess<br>-ional manner. The unit will tackle the big issues facing the IT industry with a focus on gender equity and 
 diversity, <br>helping ensure our future IT leaders are well placed to address this and other challenging issues.<br>
